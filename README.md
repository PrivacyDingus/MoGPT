## How?
The latest in artificial intelligence, MoGeePeeTee uses a neural network and an advanced algorithm to come up with natural-sounding responses.

Not really though, it just returns sassy canned responses. 

## Why?
AI has truly captured the attention of both the Valley and the journalists who write about tech, and a fair few of the projects in question are seeking to replace search with answers.

Although there are some pretty obvious uses for Artificial Intelligence, one should be worried about considering it some kind of magic dust to sprinkle on all and any tech product in order to make it better. 

We already have a vast array of problems which rise from one company, you know the one, being so dominant when it comes to access to information, we should be careful about worsening that situation by deferring our learning to answer engines.
